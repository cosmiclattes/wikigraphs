		<p class="title">What is this graph?</p>
		<p>This graph shows the monthly edit activity split by the % contribution from each article cohort.</p>

	<div id="explanation">
		<p class="title">How do I read the graph?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>When an e has edits >= 5/month by logged in editors the article is considered active.</li>
			<li>Articles are grouped by the month in which they were created.</li>
			<li>X-axis (time since the start of the wiki in months)</li>
			<li>Y-axis (% contribution split by the cohorts of active articles in the month.)</li>
			<li>The brush lets you filter the graph by the age of a cohort in a month. For ex, to see the contribution of only cohorts of age 1 month in every month we select 1-2 in the brush. This lets us see the contribution of the active articles created in a month to the total active articles in the given month in %.</li>
