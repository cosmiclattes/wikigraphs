		<ul>
			<li>X-axis (time since the start of the wiki in months)</li>
			<li>Editors are grouped by the month where they made their first edit - Editor Cohorts</li>
			<li>Y-axis (editor cohorts)</li>
			<li>Each data point in a row gives the percentage of article which were created in a given month (column) by the editor cohort(row).</li>
			<li>The demoninator at each data point is the total number of articles that were created in a month.</li>
			<li>The brush lets you filter by the percentage values of the data points.</li>
