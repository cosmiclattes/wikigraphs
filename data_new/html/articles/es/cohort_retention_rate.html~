		<p class="title">How do I read the graph?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>When an article has edits >= 5/month the article is counted as edited. If it has had only a single edit it isn't counted.</li>
			<li>X-axis (time since the start of the wiki in months)</li>
			<li>Articles are grouped by the month where they made their first edit - Article Cohorts</li>
			<li>Y-axis (article cohorts)</li>
			<li>Each row in the graph represents the activity of an editor group, eg: Editors who made their first edit in Jan 05.</li>
			<li>Each data point in a row gives the percentage change of articles which were actively edited in the current month over the previous month in that given row (article cohort).</li>
