		<p>This graph shows the total edit activity split to an article cohort over its lifetime.</p>

		<p class="title">How do I read the graph?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>When an article has edits >= 5/month by logged in editors the article is considered active.</li>
			<li>Articles are grouped by the month in which they were created - article cohort.</li>
			<li>X-axis (time since the start of the wiki)</li>
			<li>Y-axis (article cohorts)</li>
			<li>Each row gives the total edit sessions for a given article cohort.</li>
			<li>Each data point gives the edit sessions for a given article cohort in a given month since birth.</li>
			<li>The brush lets you look at the monthly activity of the cohorts. For ex, to see the activity of every cohort in its first month select 1-2 in the filter. </li>
