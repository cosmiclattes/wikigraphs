		<p class="title">What is this graph?</p>
		<p>This graph shows the relationship between the number of months an editor has edited in and the number of articles the editor has edited. On the Y-axis we arrange editors by the number of months they have edited in and on the X-axis we have the number of articles. The number of articles are buckets which are multiples of 5.</p>

	<div id="explanation">
		<p class="title">How do I read the graph?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>X-axis - Number of editors, buckets in multiples of 5.</li>
			<li>Y-axis - Number of months the editor has edited in.</li>
			<li>Each data point is the percentage of editors that have edited(no of articles - X-axis) from the total number of editors who have edited in (no of months Y-axis)</li>
			<li>The brush lets you filter by the percentage values of the data points.</li>
