		<p class="title">How do I read the graph?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>When an editor has edits >= 5/month by logged in editors the editor is considered active.</li>
			<li>editors are grouped by the month in which they were created.</li>
			<li>X-axis (time since the start of the wiki in months)</li>
			<li>Y-axis (editor cohorts)</li>
			<li>Each row shows the longevity/retention of an editor cohort over time.</li>
			<li>Each data point gives the percentage of editors who were active in a given month (column) from the cohort(row).</li>
			<li>The demoninator in each row, is the total number of editors who were active in a given cohort in its lifetime.</li>
			<li>The brush lets you filter the percentage values.</li>
