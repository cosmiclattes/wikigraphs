		<p class="title">How do I read the graph?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>When an editor has edits >= 5/month the editor is considered active.</li>
			<li>Editors are grouped by the month in which they mzde their first edit.</li>
			<li>X-axis (time since the start of the wiki in months)</li>
			<li>Y-axis (% contribution split by the cohorts of active editors in the month.)</li>
			<li>Each data point gives the %contribution of a editor cohort in a given month.</li>
			<li>The brush lets you filter the graph by the age of a cohort in a month. For ex, to see the contribution of only cohorts of age 1 month in every month we select 1-2 in the brush. This lets us see the contribution of the active editors created in a month to the total active editors in the given month in %.</li>
