		<ul>
			<li>X-axis (time since the start of the wiki in months)</li>
			<li>Y-axis (editors are grouped by the month in which they were created - editor cohorts)</li>
			<li>Each data point gives the percentage of bytes added by an editor cohort in a month.</li>
			<li>The denominator is the total number of bytes added in a month.</li>
			<li>The brush lets you filter by the age of an editor cohort.</li>
